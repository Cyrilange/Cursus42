Crowdfunding Platform: Create campaigns, donations, updates, and community engagement with chat .

BLOCKCHAIN PAYMENT :

for this project , the paiment for the  campagnes so the donations will be made via blockchain etherum , 
via a wallet
but the user can connect itself in web2 way with mail number gioogle github and so choose a name , number , mail and even post his foto 
Users will be abble to chat between themselves once connected 


----------------------------------------- 

Major: Use a framework for both the frontend and backend.
Full-stack frameworks (Next.js) count as both if you use : tsx , tailwind, react , express , hardhat
both their frontend and backend capabilities

# FRONTEND — Next.js (React)
# why : React + routing integrated + SSR/SSG natif.
#  (SEO, perf,clean structure).

# BACKEND — Node.js + Express
# why : simple, light, full JS, ultra compatible with Next.js.
# API REST, auth web2, logique métier.

# BLOCKCHAIN — Hardhat (Web3)
# why : standard for Ethereum.
# Tests, smart contracts, intégration easy with

-----------------------------------------------

Major: Allow users to interact with other users. The minimum requirements are:
◦ A basic chat system (send/receive messages between users).
◦ A profile system (view user information).
◦ A friends system (add/remove friends, see friends list).

------------------------------------------

Major: A public API to interact with the database with a secured API key, rate
limiting, documentation, and at least 5 endpoints:
◦ GET /api/{something}
◦ POST /api/{something}
◦ PUT /api/{something}
◦ DELETE /api/{something}


The API will be served to simulate users and differents campagns, we can use : https://mockapi.io/

-----------------------------------

Minor: Custom-made design system with reusable components, including a proper
color palette, typography, and icons (minimum: 10 reusable components).

Perfect with react as it is a components base 

---------------------------------------

Minor: Implement advanced search functionality with filters, sorting, and pagination.


--------------------------------------

 User Management
• Major: Standard user management and authentication.
◦ Users can update their profile information.
◦ Users can upload an avatar (with a default avatar if none provided).
◦ Users can add other users as friends and see their online status.
◦ Users have a profile page displaying their information.

it is a must so you can update your informations , photos , add or delete friends 

----------------------------------------
V.10 Modules of choice : web3
• Major: Implement a custom module that is not listed above.
◦ The module must be substantial and demonstrate technical complexity.
◦ You must provide proper justification in your README.md explaining:

∗ Why you chose this module. ==>  because the paimenet should be peer to peer 

∗ What technical challenges it addresses. ==> making smart contract without obiging people to conenct via wallet for the rest of app

∗ How it adds value to your project. ==> security and decentralisation

∗ Why it deserves Major module status (2 points). ==> it is a whole module and so we need to think security , access for user and also cost gaz efficiency
