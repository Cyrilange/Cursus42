# Inception


<br>

## **Description**
<br>
The Inception project aims to introduce the fundamentals of system administration and DevOps practices using Docker and Docker Compose.  
The goal of this project is to build a secure, modular, and reproducible infrastructure composed of multiple services running in isolated containers.

The project focuses on deploying a WordPress website served by NGINX, using MariaDB as the database, all running inside Docker containers and communicating through a dedicated Docker network. Special attention is given to security, data persistence, and proper service separation.
